        <h3>Time allocation: 15 mins</h3>
    <h3>Graded</h3>

    <p>This exercise will serve as a summary of everything that you have learned about Basic
        HTML. Take note that this is a graded exercise and you are required to submit your final output to
        your teacher. </p>
   
    <h4>1. Create four (4) HTML files. </h4>

        <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <p>a. All four files should contain the meta tags discussed in the previous lessons to
                document your work. </p>
                
            <p>b. The first file will contain a header (use h1), a horizontal rule, and three links. Add a
                paragraph after the three links. The links will lead a user to three other HTML files.
                Name this file as home.html. Refer to figure 4 for a sample homepage. 
                </p>
        
            <p>c. Use 100px by 100px images for the links. Remember to add alternate texts to your
                images. Feel free to use any image files available to you. </p>
        
            <p>d. The three other files will contain a header (use h1), a horizontal rule, and an
                    unordered list. Each file will have the same format as the others but have different
                    content. Name the files as page1.html, page2.html, and page3.html. These will be
                    subpages. Refer to figure 5 for a sample subpage. </p>
        
            <p>e. The unordered list in the subpages should contain at least three items.</p>
        
        </div>
 
   

    <p>2. All images used should be placed in a folder named images. All subpages should be placed in
        a folder named files. Use the concept of file paths in your code. Refer to figure 3 for a
        visualization of the expected file structure.</p>

    <p>3. Save all your files in a folder named exercise_surname. Remember to submit multiple files
        as zipped files. </p>

    </div>
